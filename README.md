# EUDIW ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ºðŸ‡±ðŸ‡»: Android App

This project is the **NOBID [EUDIW](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home) Latvia** App for Android.

It bundles and uses **EUDIW Latvia WebApp** (built on [LX/UI platform](https://github.com/wntrtech/lx-ui)) for consistent UI and should offer feature parity with **EUDIW iOS App**.

## 1. Prerequisites

To successfully compile and run the project, the following tools are required:

* **Android Studio** (latest stable version recommended)
* **Java Development Kit (JDK)** â€“ version 17
* **Android SDK** with proper API levels
* **Gradle** (bundled with Android Studio) â€“ version 8.10.2
* **Android Gradle Plugin (AGP)** â€“ version 8.8.0
* **Git** for version control
* **Node.js** + **pnpm** (JavaScript package manager) for WebView app build
* Install `pnpm` globally:

  ```bash
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```

---

## 2. Cloning the Project

```bash
git clone https://example.com/mobile-android.git
cd mobile-android
```

---

## 3. Initializing the WebView (Vue) Application

The app includes an embedded Vue.js application used in WebView, located at:
`resources-logic/src/main/assets/vue-app/`

To initialize and build it:

```bash
cd resources-logic/src/main/assets/vue-app
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

---

## 4. Opening and Building the Project in Android Studio

1. Launch Android Studio.
2. Open the root directory of the project.
3. Sync Gradle (if it doesnâ€™t happen automatically: **File > Sync Project with Gradle Files**).
4. Select the appropriate **product flavor** (`demo`, `prod`, etc.).
5. Choose the target emulator/device and run the app via **Run** or `Shift+F10`.
6. The main `AndroidManifest.xml` file is located in the `assembly-logic` module:

```
assembly-logic/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
```

This manifest is considered the **main one** and contains:

* the main `application` tag,
* `activity` definitions,
* deeplink configuration (generated during build).

Other modules (`feature`, `core`, etc.) include only additional parts (`manifestPlaceholders` or `library manifests`), which are merged at build time.

---

## 5. Building Release Version

Release builds are generated automatically via CI/CD using the `release.yml` GitHub Actions pipeline. To trigger it:

1. Create a Git tag in the following format:

   ```bash
   git tag v1.2.3
   git push origin v1.2.3
   ```

2. The CI system will automatically start the release build and generate APK/AAB artifacts.

## 8. Deeplink Schemes

| Deeplink URI                         | Function           | Description                                                |

## 9. Additional Information

### 9.1. Library Version Management (`libs.versions.toml`)

All external library versions are centrally managed in the following file:

```
gradle/libs.versions.toml
```

This ensures version consistency across all modules. Example:

```toml
[libraries]
kotlin-coroutines = "org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.7.3"
retrofit = "com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0"
```

---

### 9.2. Building Android Releases (Official Documentation)

Full guide for building and publishing Android releases is available in the official documentation:
ðŸ“Œ [https://developer.android.com/studio/publish](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish)

It includes:

* Building APK/AAB
* Signing configuration (`keystore`, `keyAlias`, etc.)
* Publishing to Google Play Store

---

### 9.3. Endpoint Configuration per Build Variant

Depending on the build flavor, the app uses different server endpoints. They are defined in:

```
core-logic/src/main/kotlin/com/edim/config/ConfigLogicImpl.kt
```

This approach provides flexibility for testing, demo, and production environments.

---

### 9.4. Code Signing (Release build)

Signing configuration is done via `keystore.properties`, which is **not version-controlled** and stored locally or in CI.

Example file:

```
storeFile=keystore.jks
storePassword=********
keyAlias=releaseKey
keyPassword=********
```

In CI/CD, `secrets` are used to sign without exposing sensitive info.
